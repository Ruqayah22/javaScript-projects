> transform: translate(-50%, -50%); is used to move an element by a certain percentage of its own size: 
 translate(-50%, -50%): The translate function shifts the element along the X-axis and Y-axis. 1. 50% on the X-axis: Moves the element left by 50% of its own width. 2. 50% on the Y-axis: Moves the element up by 50% of its own height.

### The line this.classList.toggle('completed') is used to add or remove the completed class from the task element that was clicked.
- this refers to the task element that triggered the onclick event. So when you click on a task, this represents that specific task element.

- .classList is a property of the element that provides access to the list of classes the element has. It allows you to add, remove, or toggle classes on the element.

- .toggle('completed') does two things: If the completed class is not already applied to the element, toggle adds it. If the completed class is already applied, toggle removes it.
