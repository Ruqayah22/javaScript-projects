# try, catch, finally, throw - error handling in JavaScript
- [error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFTFtuEQ-10)

1. try{}
    - the try statement lets you test a block of code for errors.
2. catch()
    - the catch statement lets you handle the error.
3. throw() 
    - the throw statement lets you create custom errors.
4. finally{}
    - the final statement lets you execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.

- if i have a an opening brace here and then i don't have the ending brace and then if i if i try to run that well that's not going to work this is called a parse time error.
- try catch only handles runtime errors
